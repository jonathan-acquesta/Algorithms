# Objective

Develop an algorithm that calculates the BMI of a certain person, and record the results in a text file, where when accessing the application you will be asked if you want to make a new registration or consult the existing ones. When registering a new BMI calculation, it will be necessary to inform the name, age, weight and height. The BMI is calculated by dividing the weight (in kilograms) by the height (in meters) squared. When writing to a text file, the previous data must be kept.

# Key-Results
- Show the file data
- Calculate the Body Mass Index
